/*
The following is a typical example XML that we'd get back from the system.

If Self="true" then the Intersection is the local machine.  This "Self" Intersection node is special and has a Network node for all intersections associated with the configuration.
Example:
<ConfigurationNetworkStatus>
    <Intersection IP="192.168.31.152" Name="Test Intersection 4" Configuration="Config # 1" IsInCurrentSolution="True" IsFacilitator="true" CorridorHash="108C8B807F648B2CD38E4C3ED5C852E1"/>
    <Intersection IP="192.168.31.153" Self="true" Name="Test Intersection_2" Configuration="Config # 3" IsInCurrentSolution="True" IsFacilitator="false" CorridorHash="108C8B807F648B2CD38E4C3ED5C852E1">
        <Network IP="192.168.31.152" Status="OfflineConsecutiveFailures"/>
        <Network IP="192.168.31.153" Status="OfflineSoft"/>
    </Intersection>
</ConfigurationNetworkStatus>


If a node is not "Self", then the Network nodes underneath that Intersection are only going to be built for each Intersection that is physically unreachable.  This means that you can only infer about failures and not about
successful communication lists.  In this example, 192.168.31.153 is not Self and only reports 192.168.31.154 even though .152 and .153 are also part of the solution.
Example:

<ConfigurationNetworkStatus>
    <Intersection IP="192.168.31.152" Self="true" Name="Test Intersection 4" Configuration="Config # 1" IsInCurrentSolution="True" IsFacilitator="true" CorridorHash="59B9AE477578499A6BB17D5365A535F3">
        <Network IP="192.168.31.152" Status="OfflineSoft"/>
        <Network IP="192.168.31.153" Status="OfflineSoft"/>
        <Network IP="192.168.31.154" Status="OnlineWaiting"/>
    </Intersection>
    <Intersection IP="192.168.31.153" Name="Test Intersection_2" Configuration="Config # 3" IsInCurrentSolution="True" IsFacilitator="false" CorridorHash="59B9AE477578499A6BB17D5365A535F3">
        <Network IP="192.168.31.154" Status="OfflineConsecutiveFailures"/>
    </Intersection>
    <Intersection IP="192.168.31.154" Name="Test Intersection" Configuration="Config # 2" IsInCurrentSolution="True" IsFacilitator="false" CorridorHash=""/>
</ConfigurationNetworkStatus>

Documentation for the XML format is as follows (following a Element/Attribute convention):

Intersection/IP is the IP address for the Intersection
Intersection/Self is "true" or "false" where "true" is the Self and "false" is not the Self
Intersection/Name is the current Intersection Name reported based on what the Self intersection thinks each Intersection is named (and is based on the Corridor file at that intersection).
Intersection/Configuration is the currently active Configuration reported based on what the Self intersection thinks each Intersection should be running (and is based on the Corridor file at that intersection).
Intersection/IsInCurrentSolution is "true" or "false" based on whether the Self intersection thinks that Intersection is involved in the current Configuration (and is based on the Corridor file at that intersection).
Intersection/IsFacilitator is "true" or "false" based on whether the Self intersection thinks that Intersection is the currently active Facilitator for the current Configuration (and is based on the Corridor file at that intersection).
Intersection/CorridorHash represents what the currently reported Corridor Hash is for each intersection.  This data is reported based on what the "Self" intersection thinks each Corridor hash is and is not compiled at request time.

Network/IP is the IP address for the Intersection
Network/Status can be one of the following:
OnlineWaiting  --------------------- Intersection is marked "Online" but we have yet to determine its status.
Online ----------------------------- Intersection is marked "Online" and we have confirmed its status.
OfflineConsecutiveFailures --------- Intersection is unable to be reached and shows consecutive communication failures.
OfflineInconsistentCommunication --- Intersection is unable to be reached and shows an unacceptable failure rate rather than consistent failure.
OfflineSoft ------------------------ Intersection is ensuring the corridor is in an "Offline" status until all communications are verified further.
